### This code is for the identification of influential genes, survival analysis, and validation

##
**Influential Genes and Survival Analysis:**
1. The file "Influential_Genes_and_Survival.R" is for the identification of influential genes and survival analysis of those genes
2. Two files are required to run the code: </br>
     I. [coadread_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018_clinical_data.csv](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1ld7jrUADl9o7cMsZr9IjEVUZLZed1qIi) </br>
     II. [data_mrna_seq_v2_rsem_zscores_ref_all_samples.csv](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1ld7jrUADl9o7cMsZr9IjEVUZLZed1qIi)
3. The code will provide a list of influential genes with P value, Adj. P value and logFC
4. The code will also provide survival information and survival curves of the genes
